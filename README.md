## Explaining the project and the database

My final project is a website that provide some job opportunity for worker. But instead of doing a normal job hunting website, I used my imagination to create a Medieval Tavern instead which provide lots of quest and mission for Adventurer to choose which one will fit their abilities and from that for the ultra goal is: Making money. And the website does provide a quest accept for people who have problem or quest that need our adventurer help too. 

### SQLalchemy and mySQL:
I need 2 tables for my database:
1. Jobs table, Where I put id, title, location, salary, currency, responsibilities, requirements. id is primary key
2. Applications table, where I put job_id, full_name, email, profession, abilities, experience. job_id is primary key

So basically all information about the quest and updated quest input by user will be stored in jobs table and all the applications from adventurer that input by user will be stored in applications table. 
i use sqlalchemy to connect database and mySQL to application to manage her.

### Acknownledgement and thank you
